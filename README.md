## Data Cleaning Project: Myntra Dataset
# Introduction

### This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a sales dataset from Myntra, which contains product details, customer information, and sales records. The original data was noisy, with inconsistencies, duplicates, and missing values. By leveraging Power Query, a systematic data cleaning process was implemented to ensure the dataset is ready for analysis.

# Key steps in this project included:

1. Identifying and handling duplicates and missing values.
2. Standardizing data types, text formatting, and categorical values.
3. Resolving mismatches between product categories and associated products.
4. Transforming the discount column into percentages and extracting meaningful insights like the sales month.
5. Imputing missing values thoughtfully to preserve data integrity.

# After the cleaning process:

- The dataset reduced from 1050 rows to 858 rows.
* Key inconsistencies were eliminated, resulting in a well-structured dataset.
+ This cleaned dataset provides a robust foundation for further analytics and modeling tasks. Feel free to explore the detailed steps in the repository and share your thoughts!
